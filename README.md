# hello-world
This is the first repository I'm making on GitHUB with hopefully many more to come. I have always loved playing with software even though I have a an economics background. I'm a little intimidated and a lot more excited, but I'm sure I'll get my hands dirty and learn this one too. Good luck to myself!
I just wanted to add that I'm already loving it.
